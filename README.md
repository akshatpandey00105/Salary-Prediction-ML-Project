# Salary Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts employee salaries based on features like Age, Gender, Degree, Job Title, and Years of Experience using machine learning models.

## 📂 Files Included
- `salary_prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the complete workflow for data preprocessing, model training, and predictions.  
- `dataset.csv`: The raw dataset used for training and testing the machine learning models.  

## ⚙️ Models Used
- Linear Regression
- Random Forest Regression
- Gradient Boosting Regression

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset (`dataset.csv`) provided in this repository is **raw and unprocessed**.  
All necessary data preprocessing steps like renaming columns, handling missing values, encoding categorical data, and scaling numerical features are performed **inside the Jupyter Notebook**.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone or download this repository.  
2. Open `salary_prediction.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.  
3. Run the cells step by step.  
4. The notebook will automatically preprocess the dataset and train the models.  

## ✅ Results
- **Gradient Boosting Accuracy**: 91.74%  
- **Random Forest Accuracy**: 91.52%  
- **Linear Regression Accuracy**: 89.11%

## 📌 Notes
- The dataset is raw; **no preprocessing is done beforehand**.  
- Make sure `dataset.csv` is placed in the same directory as the notebook.
